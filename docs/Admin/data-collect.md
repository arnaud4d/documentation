To help us make our products always better, we automatically collect data regarding usage statistics and incidents on running 4D Server applications. Collected data are completely anonymous and data is transfered with no impact on the user experience. 

This page explains:

- what information is collected
- where this information is stored and when it is sent to 4D servers
- how to disable the automatic data collection in built client-server applications



## Collected information

Data is collected at the following steps: at 4D Server startup, at database opening and closure, as well as at  webserver startup.

## Where is it stored and how is it sent?

Data collected at every event above is saved in a text file (JSON format) inside the [active 4D folder](https://doc.4d.com/4dv19/help/command/en/page485.html), i.e.:

- Windows: `Users\[userName]\AppData\Roaming\4D` and `Users\[userName]\AppData\Roaming\4D Server`
- mocOS: `/Users/[userName]/Library/ApplicationSupport/4D` and `/Users/[userName]/Library/ApplicationSupport/4D Server`



 your user ID (email or 4D account) as well as your password. If you do not have an existing user account, you will need to create it at the following address:

[https://account.4d.com/us/login.shtml](https://account.4d.com/us/login.shtml)

![](assets/en/getStart/activ1.png)

Then enter the license number of the product you want to activate. This number is provided by email or by mail after a product is purchased.

## Disabling data collection in built c/s applications

If you are unable to use [instant activation](#instant-activation) because your computer does not have internet access, please proceed to deferred activation using the following steps.

1. In the License Manager window, select the **Deferred Activation** tab.
2. Enter the License Number and your e-mail address, then click **Generate file** to create the ID file (*reg.txt*).

![](assets/en/getStart/activ3.png)

3. Save the *reg.txt* file to a USB drive and take it to a computer that has internet access.
4. On the machine with internet access, login to [https://activation.4d.com](https://activation.4d.com).
5. On the Web page, click on the **Choose File...** button and select the *reg.txt* file from steps 3 and 4; then click on the **Activate** button.
6. Download the serial file(s).

![](assets/en/getStart/activ4.png)

7. Save the *license4d* file(s) on a shared media and transfer them back to the 4D machine from step 1.
8. Now back on the machine with 4D, still on the **Deferred Activation** page, click **Next**; then click the **Load...** button and select a *license4d* file from the shared media from step 7.

With the license file loaded, click on **Next**.

![](assets/en/getStart/activ6.png)

9. Click on the **Add NÂ°** button to add another license. Repeat these steps until all licenses from step 6 have been integrated.

Your 4D application is now activated.

### Emergency Activation

This mode can be used for a special temporary activation of 4D (5 days maximum) without connecting to the 4D Web site. This activation can only be used one time.


## Adding licenses  

You can add new licenses, for example to extend the capacities of your application, at any time.

Choose the **License Manager...** command from the **Help** menu of the 4D or 4D Server application, then click on the **Refresh** button:

![](assets/en/getStart/licens1.png)

This button connects you to our customer database and automatically activates any new or updated licenses related to the current license (the current license is displayed in **bold** in the "Active Licenses" list). You will just be prompted for your user account and password. 

- If you purchased additional expansions for a 4D Server, you do not need to enter any license number -- just click **Refresh**.
- At the first activation of a 4D Server, you just need to enter the server number and all the purchased expansions are automatically assigned.

You can use the **Refresh** button in the following contexts:

- When you have purchased an additional expansion and want to activate it,
- When you need to update an expired temporary number (Partners or evolutions).



## 4D Online Store  

In 4D Store, you can order, upgrade, extend, and/or manage 4D products. You can reach the store at the following address: [https://store.4d.com/us/](https://store.4d.com/us/) (you will need to select your country).

Click **Login** to sign in using your existing account or **New Account** to create a new one, then follow the on-screen instructions.

### License Management 

After you log in, you can click on **License list** at the top right of the page:

![](assets/en/getStart/licens2.png)

Here you can manage your licenses by assigning them to projects. 

Select the appropriate license from the list then click **Link to a project... >**:

![](assets/en/getStart/licens3.png)

You can either select an existing project or create a new one:
