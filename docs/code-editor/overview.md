4D has a powerful built-in code editor that offers a wide array of features for highly productive code editing such as intelligent code completion, code navigation, debugging, and more. 

## Writing classes and methods

The 4D code editor works much like a text editor. Writing a [method](../Concepts/methods.md) or a [class](../Concepts/classes.md) is usually a combination of creating that method or class, editing its code, executing it and checking for bugs.

Classes and methods allow you to set the behavior and flow of data of your forms and form objects.

Methods and classes can include up to 32,000 lines of code or 2 GB of text. 

### Checking for errors

The 4D code editor provides basic syntax error-checking. Additional error-checking is performed when the method or class function is executed. For more information on how to handle errors, see [Debugging](../Debugging/basics.md).
