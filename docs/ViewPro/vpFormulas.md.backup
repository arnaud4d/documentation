title: 4D View Pro Formulas
---

4D View Pro functions are used in formulas. Every 4D View Pro formula is an expression that returns a value. All expressions are comprised of operands and operators:

*	**Operators**: see *Operators and values*
*	**Operands** are divided into several categories:
	*	values,
	*	references to other cells (relatives, absolutes, mixed or by name), 
	*	4D variables, fields and functions,
	*	4D methods (registered by `VP SET ALLOWED METHODS`), 
	*	4D formulas (via `VP SET CUSTOM FUNCTIONS`),
	*	4D View Pro functions.

To enter a formula:

1.	Select the cell into which you will enter the formula or function.
2.	Enter = (the equal sign).
3.	Type in the formula then hit the Enter key

>You can also create named formulas that can be called via their name. In this case, the formula is entered using the `VP ADD FORMULA NAME` command.

A large number of functions are available in 4D View Pro. This section describes a subset of essential functions. The complete list of functions supported by 4D View Pro can be found in the [Spreadsheets documentation](http://help.grapecity.com/spread/SpreadSheets11/webframe.html#FormulaFunctions.html).
