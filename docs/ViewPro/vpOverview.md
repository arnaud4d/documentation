4D View Pro is a component and a 4D form area that allow developers to embed advanced spreadsheet features in their forms. 


## Installation and activation  

4D View Pro features are directly included in 4D itself, making it easy to deploy and manage. No additional installation is required.

However, 4D View Pro requires the a license. You need to have this license installed in your application in order to use its features. When the 4D View Pro license is not installed, the contents of an object that requires a 4D View Pro feature are not displayed at runtime and an error message is displayed instead.

In this example, a 4D View Pro license is missing while displaying a 4D View Pro spreadsheet area:
