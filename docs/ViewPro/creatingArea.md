4D View Pro allows you to insert spreadsheet areas in your 4D forms.

## Creating the area  

4D View Pro documents are displayed and edited manually in a 4D form object named 4D View Pro. This object is available as part of the last tool (Plug-in Area, Web Area, etc.) found in the object bar:

## Setting standard area properties

A 4D View Pro form area is configured by means of standard properties found in the Property List, such as **Object Name** and **Variable or Expression**, **Coordinates**, **Display**, **Action**, and **Events**.
