4D View Pro features are directly included in 4D itself, making it easy to deploy and manage. No additional installation is required.

However, 4D View Pro requires a license. You need to have this license installed in your application in order to use its features. When the 4D View Pro license is not installed, the contents of an object that requires a 4D View Pro feature are not displayed at runtime. An error message is displayed instead:
