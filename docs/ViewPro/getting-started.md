4D View Pro allows you to insert spreadsheet areas in your 4D forms.

## Creating the area  

4D View Pro documents are displayed and edited manually in a  [4D form object](FormObjects/formObjects_overview.md) named 4D View Pro. To access this object, click on the last tool in the object bar:

## Setting standard area properties

Using the area's property list, you can set standard properties such as **Object Name**, **Variable or Expression**, **Appearance**, **Action**, and **Events**.

*	**Object Name**: name of the 4D form area that contains and displays the 4D View Pro document.
*	**Variable or Expression**: name of the 4D View Pro form area variable.

## Executing the form

By default, when the form is executed, the 4D View Pro area displays a spreadsheet with a Ribbon:

## Adding a user interface

You can add interfaces to 4D View Pro areas. They allow for basic modifications and data manipulation. The Ribbon is set by default in the property list. 

These interfaces can be enabled or disabled either:

*	in the **Property List**, under **Appearance**:

*	using a **JSON file** (see  [Dynamic Forms](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv19/4D/19/Dynamic-Forms.300-5416668.en.html)) with the following properties:
	*	"userInterface": Default value is "none". To add an interface, set it to "Ribbon" or "Toolbar".
	*	"withFormulaBar": Default value is "false". To enable the formula bar, set it to "true" . **Note**: Available only for the "Toolbar" interface. 

Both the Ribbon and the Toolbar interfaces group related actions into the following tabs: 	

|Tab| 	Actions	|Ribbon Interface|	Toolbar Interface|
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
|File|File manipulation|X| |	 
|Home|Text appearance|X|X|
|Insert|Add items| X| X|
|Formulas|Formula calculation and library|	 X|X|
|Data|Data manipulation|X| X|
|View|Visual presentation| X| X|
|Settings|Sheet presentation reference|X| |	 


User-defined modifications are saved in the 4D View Pro object when the user saves the document.
